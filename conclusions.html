  <h3>Where are smart contracts being used today?</h3>
  <p>Smart contracts are already being used today in business agreements and between private parties.  Household brand name Kodak made waves as recently as January 2018 for adopting the blockchain into its business practices.  And not just cryptocurrency but actual smart contract useage. Kodak believes that smart contracts can play a vital role in resolving an age old issue of proper artist attribution and creative ownership of photographs.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kodak-boards-the-blockchain-bandwagon-2018-01-09" target="new_window">“For photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem”</a></p>
  <p>Kodak goes on to say that while it is currently using Ethereum smart contracts for initial solutions, the company is looking into in house development of a proprietary blockchain that could carry all of the Kodak smart contracts amongst its ledgers.</p>
  <p>Besides this larger corporate example, many individuals are using smart contracts for other interactions.  A user on the popular social networking website Reddit recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7p155y/i_just_warranty_deeded_my_house_into_an_ethereum/" target="new_window">posted proof that he signed the deed to his house via a blockchain smart contract</a>.  While this may be a very dramatic example of the smart contract usage, it is nonetheless a valid proof of concept.</p>

  <h3>What technical changes may help smart contracts be adopted more widely?</h3>
  <p>The biggest technological changes in implementing smart contracts are most likely already resolved.  We can see through the widie rise and use of crypto currencies that blockchain technologies are largely adopted and trusted by many people with very high amounts of value.  Any continuing technology growth would most likely revolve around user security.  Solutions such as two or three factor authentication will make the use of blockchain wallets more secure.</p>
  <p>In this realm there may still be more room to grow.  Biometrics continue to be a growing field, and are seeing a large amount of consumer adoption and consumer interest with solutions such as fingerprint, facial, or retinal scanners being built into smartphones.  If these biometric scanners became more widely adopted in the verification of accessing a digital blockchain wallet it could help to ensure the security around smart contracts.  By utilizing some physical verification such as a biometric, some key authentication such as a time-based one-time password (TOTP), and a significantly complex passphrase; a user could be almost guaranteed more security than traditional means of verifying and authorizing as well as authoring legally binding contracts and signatures.</p>
  <p>The future for smart contracts depends on the future of internet security technologies.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>What does the future hold for smart contracts?</h3>
  <p>As the internet becomes more a part of people’s daily lives it is only natural that internet based solutions to real life problems will also become more common in people’s daily lives.  Issues that currently plague systems or technologies tend to be overcome through either further technological advances or cultural and legal shifts in the way people interface with these technologies.  The future then for smart contracts will most likely be similar to the present, except more prevalent in day to day usage and more trusted and relied upon by a variety of peoples.</p>
  <p>Issues such as the ones talked about in this tutorial will likely be mitigated through more security and legal advancements, and assuming the contracts become accepted by the wider public, a culture shift towards relying on these contracts over traditional ones will most likely take place. </p>
  <p>It is hard to imagine a glamourous future for a piece of novel technology that is ultimately solving a bureaucratic issue, and that is probably the best for smart contract adoption.  That the technology should become so commonplace as any other technology we have currently adopted, such as a laptop, smartphone, or website, is the ultimate victory for an emerging tech. </p>
